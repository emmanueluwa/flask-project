# flask make-Notes Project

### Description
Created a notes app using Flask with Python, HTML and a little JavaScript to help with the interactive side of the application. This project is a simple app that allows the user to sign up and make an account, the user will then be allowed to save notes to their homepage and delete the notes. The application also allows you to log in using the username and password you have created which will be saved to the Database, and the option to logout is also available.

Feel free to try the app yourself. Click the top left option to open the menu bar and click sign up, after doing so succesfully you will be able create and delete notes of your own.
When running Heroku will take a moment to load so there will be a slight delay in loading the web app, thank you for your patience.

## Criteria 
- Build home, Login, Logout and signup pages
- Only allow access to certain pages once signed in
- only allow valid credentials when signing up
- Implement cache so it is quicker to sign in after signing in once already
- Develop script for notes to be created and saved and also deleted when 'x' button is clicked
- Use Heroku to deploy the application

## Tech Stack
- Python
- JavaScript
- Flask
- SQLALchemy
- HTML
- Heroku

## To-Do
- The option bar at the top left to access the menu may not be obvious to all visitors of the web app, although I personally prefer the clean tucked away look, the menu could be changed to show all options by default without having to click and then have the option to hide the menu. This will ensure that the app is easy to understand for all users.
